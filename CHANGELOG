Changelog

Last update: September 10th, 2022
(Hardwareversion / Softwareversion)

v2.12 / v2.12
==============
- fixes:
  - do not use scanlines if output mode is 240p/288p
  - menu navigation when entering scaling menu in 240p/288p
- optimize ADV7513 setup just a tiny bit for the first run through the main loop
- update acknowledgment and license text in menu

v2.11 / v2.11b
===============
- add new PCB revision to menu
- no additional changes, just the first release for the public repo

v2.11 / v2.11
==============
- fixes:
  - audio volume
  - button combinations for 16bit mode on/off (they were exchanged in fw.)
- add an option to bypass the audio filter
- move re-sync video pipeline function to video-info screen
- do not soft lock soft-CPU while waiting for PLL or HDMI  
  (needed to control VI-DeBlur on N64RGB_Flex)
- hold complete video and audio processing on reset if not used 

v2.10 / v2.10
==============
- fixes (among some others)
  - PAL 1440p (16:9)
  - 240p/288p AVI settings
- add YCbCr
- reset masking (e.g. mask reset from VI pipeline for speedrunners)
- copy function NTSC->PAL / PAL->NTSC settings
- introduce selection of Integer and Integer (soft) scaling. Integer (soft) was previous implementation
- remove unused menu entries

v2.09 / v2.09
==============
- fixes:
  - scaler engine for integer scaling (interpalation pixel was inserted for integer scaling)
  - 240p/288p output mode setup
- add 1440p in 16:9 mode (using HDMI Tx ICs 2x scaling, which effectively mean that only even integer scaling remains an integer scale)  
  (1440p in 4:3 should be preferred if this works for you!!!)
- add scanline calculation on color based as an option

v2.08 / v2.08
==============
- some adaptations on the scanlines algorithm(s) incl. new adaptive scanlines settings
- set different interpolation type for horizontal and vertical scaling
- different minor bug fixes and improvements

v2.07 / v2.07
=============
- v2.07a: Quick bugfix release: weave deinterlacing now reading from correct SDRAM bank for each field
- IT IS GETTING CLOSE TO A PUBLIC RELEASE
- Scanline emulation now related to scaling process
- Profiles for scanlines implemented to have a uniquer feel for non-integer scaling factors
- Weave deinterlacing (might be buggy, not sure. Especially PAL does not look good)
- Some serious and minor bugfixes in scaler engine (hopefully not intruduced new ones :P)
- Reset via controller is now enabled by default

v2.06a / v2.06a (bugfix release)
================================
- switch to Quartus Prime v21.1
- menu bugfixes (thanks to TzorriMahm)
- Restructure scaler and use BRAM much more efficiently

v2.06 / v2.06
=============
- menu appearence change
- 240p and 1440p available
- scaling in pixelwise precision available
- boot sequence changes
- add avi for HDMI output


v2.05 / v2.05 and before
========================
- closed alpha/beta releases
- no documentation other than commit messages available
